## Image-Classification-using-CNN
##### Building a Dog/Cat classifier using Image Preprocessing and Convolutional Neural Networks
*Image classification* has a few uses and vast potential as it grows in reliability. 
Here are just a few examples of what makes it useful.

+ Self Driving cars use image classification to identify whatâ€™s around them i.e trees,people,traffic-lights,etc.

- Image classification can also help in healthcare. For eg,it could analyse medical images and suggest whether they classify as depicting a symptom of illness.

### Dependencies:
+ [Numpy](https://numpy.org)
+ [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org)
+ [Keras](https://keras.io)

### Dataset:
We use a [Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/107Xj6pUqVRFFh4lYdDDvzsg7r1Hz2YYR), which contains 10,005 images of 2 classes viz Cat and Dog. The data is split into 8,005 training images and 2,000 testing images. One can send access request in order to use the same dataset. One can also choose any other dataset of their choice.

### Usage:
Simply clone the repo.<br />
`$ cd Image-Classification-using-CNN`

### Results:
Our Model Predictions:<br />
